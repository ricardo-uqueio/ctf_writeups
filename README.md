# ctf_writeups
This is where I'll share my CTF writeups

[OverTheWire Writeups](https://github.com/0xdcnx/ctf_writeups/tree/main/overthewire)

[Security Valley Writeups](https://github.com/0xdcnx/ctf_writeups/tree/main/sec_valley)

The script ```add_readme_to_subfiles.sh``` adds READMEs to subfolders, so they are included with ```git add .``` command
