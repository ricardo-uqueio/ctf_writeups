# Leviathan 2-3
`ssh leviathan2@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223`

**Solution**<br>
Solving this level involves using a very interesting trick (or rather 2 tricks). First, we take a look at the available files in the home directory with `ls -al` or it's shorthand equivalent `ll` (if available as an alias). There is a `printfile` setuid executable.

![shot0](./shots/shot0.png)

Trying to run the file tells us what it does and how to use it. It prints the contents of a file, but when we try to print the password for the next level, it does not allow us.

![shot1](./shots/shot1.png)

Just like in the previous level, let's run ltrace on the file to see what pops up:

![shot2](./shots/shot2.png)

Let's run ltrace again but this time specifying the password file for the current level which we do have permissions to read, so we can see what happens:

![shot3](./shots/shot3.png)

The file is using the `access()` method to verify that we have the right permissions before accessing the file being passed in.
After `access()` checks that we do in fact have permissions to read the file we input, it then runs `/bin/cat %s` where %s is what we input, in this case the password file for leviathan2. 

**Method 1**<br>
The issue here is that `access()` uses the full pathname for the file we provide to check for permissions, but when executing `/bin/cat %s`, the **%s** is not sanitized to make sure that what we input is really just a file name. We can take advantage of this by using a semicolon (`;`) in the filename which when passed to `%s`, allows us to execute another command after `/bin/cat`. We can verify this behavior by using `;id` in the filename and use ltrace on it:

![shot4](./shots/shot4.png)


From the output we can see that first, `access()` checks to see if we have permissions to read the file `exploit;id`. Since we do, the program then tries to run `/bin/cat %s` with %s being the file we created. Because the file contains a semicolon, it interprets this as two different commands: It first tries to run `/bin/cat exploit` and then tries to run the command `id`.

We can also see that the `id` command prints information about user leviathan3. This is because `printfile` is a setuid binary which temporarily elevates our privileges to that of user leviathan3. This means that after `access()` checks that we have permissions to read a file, the next commands are executed as user leviathan3.

All that is left is to find a way to view the password file for the next level. Instead of using `id` we can use command `sh` to spawn a terminal and run cat to get the password for the next level:

![shot5](./shots/shot5.png)

Success!

**Method 2**<br>
The second method is similar to the first in that it takes advantage of the fact that when the program tries to run `/bin/cat %s`, the %s is not sanitized.

As stated before, when `access()` runs, it uses the full pathname of the file provided to check if we have the right permissions for the file. The command `bin/cat %s` however does not check the full path of the filename provided. We can confirm this behavior by creating a filename with spaces and running ltrace on it:

![shot6](./shots/shot6.png)

We can see from the output that when a filename with spaces is provided - "one file" - `access()` is "correctly" interpreting our filename as a single file but `/bin/cat` incorrectly assumes that we are providing two files: "one" and "file" and attempts to run `/bin/cat` on both of them.
<!-- 
But since `access()` is "correctly" interpreting our "one file" as a single file, `/bin/cat` is then executed with the permissions of leviathan3. -->

In summary, the way to exploit this:

1. create a file with spaces on it's name (Ex: 'one file')
2. create a symbolic link to `/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3` using 'one'
3. run `./printfile 'one file'`
4. `access()` checks if we have the correct permissions for 'one file', we do
5. program grants us permissions for user leviathan3
6. program tries to run `/bin/cat one` and `/bin/cat file`
7. since `one` is a symlink to /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3, it prints it's contents

![shot7](./shots/shot7.png)

Success!
