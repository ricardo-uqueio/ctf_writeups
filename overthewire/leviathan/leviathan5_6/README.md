# Leviathan 5-6
`ssh leviathan5@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223`

**Solution**<br>
There is an executable file in the $HOME directory. Running it complains about a missing file:

![shot0](./shots/shot.png)

So I created the file with some content and ran it again:

![shot1](./shots/shot1.png)

It seems that our executable simply prints out the contents of `/tmp/file.log`. So How can we exploit this to get the password for the next level? We've already seen a similar approach to the one we can use here in a previous level. 

We can create a symbolic link to the password file, and since the setuid is set to run as user leviathan6, we should have permissions to read the file. 

![shot2](./shots/shot2.png)

**Password for leviathan6:** YZ55XPVk2l
