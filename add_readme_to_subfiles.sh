# This file simply generates README.md's to all subfolders in this file's path, up to 2 levels of depth
# This is so I can add my empty subfolders in git, which does not allow empty folders, without manually adding READMEs :(

# Example: Let's say this file is located under /folder/ which has the following folder structure:
# /folder/

# /folder/aaa/folderA
# /folder/aaa/folderB

# /folder/bbb/fileC
# /folder/bbb/fileD

# A README.md is then created in /folder/aaa, /folder/aaa/folderA, /folder/aaa/folderB, /folder/bbb/ ... and so on

#=======================
#PS: There should be a better way to do this, this is just what I came up with
#=======================


BASE="/path/to/git_root"

# The first iteration goes through all folders in depth level 1
for d in $BASE/*; do

    # I use cd so that afterwards I can use PWD to get the current dir as a variable
    cd "$d"
    current_dir=${PWD##*/} # gets current depth 1 dir as a variable
    

    # echoes the initial data to a README.md files in depth 1
    echo "Writeups for $current_dir challenges" > "$d/README.md"
    
    # The second iteration goes thru all folders in depth level 2
    for dd in $d/*; do
    	cd "$dd"
    	current_dir=${PWD##*/} # gets current depth level 2 dir as a variable
